## 📊 Project Descriptions

- **Breast Cancer Prediction (Gradient Boosting Classifier):** Implemented a Gradient Boosting Classifier to predict breast cancer occurrences based on medical data features.

- **Gender Classification (ID3 & Random Forest):** Utilized ID3 decision tree and Random Forest algorithms to classify gender based on specific attributes.

- **Ice Cream Sales Prediction (Logistic Regression):** Applied logistic regression to predict ice cream sales trends influenced by various factors.

- **Iris Classification (K-Nearest Neighbors):** Employed the KNN algorithm to classify iris flower species based on petal and sepal measurements.

- **Iris Classification (Naive Bayes):** Used the Naive Bayes classifier to categorize iris species, highlighting probabilistic approaches.

- **Spambase Classification (Support Vector Machine):** Implemented an SVM model to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails using textual features.

- **Titanic Survival Classification (Logistic Regression):** Built a logistic regression model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on demographic and voyage information.
